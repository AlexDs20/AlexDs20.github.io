                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Alex, born in Belgium, and moved to Sweden, Ume√• in 2015 for my PhD in space physics.
                    I defended my thesis in 2020 and stayed in Sweden where I then worked within the field of AI where I mostly worked with the developement of deep learning models in remote sensing.
                    The principle goal was to use satellite imagery to analyse and extract specific features for the forest industry.

                <h5>What and why?</h5>
                <p>
                    The internet is full of very interesting articles to read.
                    However one easily loses focus and starts doing something else on the tablet/computer.
                    On a phone, I find it nearly impossible to just read an article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My solution to this problem was to make a firefox extension.
                    The extension allows you to select parts of a webpage and save it as an html file (including images).
                    That downloaded file can then simply be send to your kindle as for any other book / file you send to your kindle.
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your reading on your kindle!
                </p>
                <h5>Where?</h5>
                <p>
                    The code for the extension is working and available on <a href="https://github.com/AlexDs20/EasyKindle">github</a>.
